      Hi! I'm a postdoctoral associate in [Steven McCarroll's lab](https://mccarrolllab.org/) at Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. I'm interested in understanding the causes and consequences of mosaicism in health and disease.

      I received a BS in biomedical engineering and mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis. After undergrad, I worked for three years as a bioinformatician at the [Genome Technology Access Center](https://gtac.wustl.edu/), a next generation sequencing core at Washington University School of Medicine.  My field experience at GTAC made me realize that I craved a career in computational genomics. I next went on to earn a PhD in computational and systems biology from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. My PhD was on *The Origins & Functional Effects of Postzygotic Mutations Throughout the Human Lifespan* and was advised by [Don Conrad](https://conradlab.org/) and [Barak Cohen](https://bclab.wustl.edu/).

      I am passionate about teaching and aspire to become a professor at a primarily undergraduate institution.

      My CV is available [here](/assets/pdf/nrockweiler.cv.pdf).
